# Turtle-Chess-Engine
This is a Chess Engine built by me from scratch as a C++ console application project using CodeBlocks IDE, I have used the Min-Max algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning mixed with many tricks to decrease the time complexity, and it can reach depth 6-7 depending on the machine it's running on.

Finally, I am looking forward to increasing the depth, linking the engine with a standard chess opening database, and making an appropriate UI.

# Notes
Every single detail will be published here in a month as a guide on how to use the engine.
